# ASLConvNet
----
Using CNNs for American Sign Language fingerspelling recognition. 


###Requirements 
----
This Project was developed using python 3.x

####Dataset

We acquired our training from a public [dataset](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~albarcza/gesture_dataset2012.html) published by the University of Massey. The dataset consists of 2524 close-up images of ASL fingerspelling with black backgrounds.

####Software
 You will need python 3.x, and the following packages

```
Numpy 
OpenCV
TensorFlow
```

###How to use? 
---
Once you have downloaded the [dataset](http://www.massey.ac.nz/~albarcza/gesture_dataset2012.html), extract all the images into one folder (called images), in the same directory as the code in src. Then run from the same directory: 

```
python alex_net2.py
```
